🧠 WebSocket vs HTTP
Feature	HTTP	WebSocket
Connection type	One-time request/response	Persistent, bidirectional
Initiated by	Client	Client initiates, then both talk
Use case	Get/post data occasionally	Real-time updates (chat, status)
Server can push data?	❌ No	✅ Yes — broadcast is possible

🔄 HTTP is still used — only to establish the WebSocket
The initial WebSocket connection starts as an HTTP handshake, then upgrades to a full-duplex protocol.
