difference between api and endpoint?


Frontend → API Gateway → Microservices
(through REST endpoints exposed by the Gateway)

Microservices → Kafka Topics → Other Microservices
(no direct HTTP between services, only event-driven communication)

Each Service has its own private REST API for its own needs (optional), but only the Gateway is usually exposed to the outside world.
The frontend app calls the API Gateway at POST /api/orders.
The Gateway routes the request to the Order Service.
The Order Service processes it, publishes an event like OrderCreated to Kafka.
The Inventory Service, Shipping Service, etc. listen to that topic and react asynchronously (reserve stock, schedule shipment).
Thing	Communication Type	How
Frontend → Backend	HTTP Request	Through API Gateway
Microservice → Microservice	Kafka Event	Through Kafka Topics
Service internal admin / ops	Sometimes HTTP	(Optional, usually private)
In very strict event-driven architectures (EDA):
Services never call each other via HTTP.
Everything is fully decoupled using events.
But in practice, many real-world systems are hybrid:
Events for 80–90% of flows (async Kafka).
Direct HTTP for some synchronous needs (rare, like payments or auth).
The API Gateway is the public face of your system.
✅ The services communicate internally through Kafka.
✅ Only the Gateway exposes endpoints to the outside world.
